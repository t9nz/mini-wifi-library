   Among fresh Fennell buds shall you this night
   <br/>
   Inherit at my house: heare all, all see:
   <br/>
   And like her most, whose merit most shall be:
   <br/>
   Which one more veiw, of many, mine being one,
   <br/>
   May stand in number, though in reckning none.
   <br/>
   Come, goe with me: goe sirrah trudge about,
   <br/>

   <br/>

   Ser. Find them out whose names are written. Heere it
is written, that the Shoo-maker should meddle with his
Yard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his
Pensill, and the Painter with his Nets. But I am sent to
find those persons whose names are writ, &amp; can neuer find
what names the writing person hath here writ (I must to
the learned) in good time.

God rest all Christian soules, were of an age. Well Susan
is with God, she was too good for me. But as I said, on Lamas
Eue at night shall she be fourteene, that shall she marie,
I remember it well. 'Tis since the Earth-quake now
eleuen yeares, and she was wean'd I neuer shall forget it,
of all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day: for I had then
laid Worme-wood to my Dug sitting in the Sunne vnder
the Douehouse wall, my Lord and you were then at
Mantua, nay I doe beare a braine. But as I said, when it
did tast the Worme-wood on the nipple of my Dugge,
and felt it bitter, pretty foole, to see it teachie, and fall out
with the Dugge, Shake quoth the Doue-house, 'twas no
neede I trow to bid mee trudge, and since that time it is

thinke it should leaue crying, &amp; say I: and yet I warrant
it had vpon it brow, a bumpe as big as a young Cockrels
stone? A perilous knock, and it cryed bitterly. Yea quoth
my husband, fall'st vpon thy face, thou wilt fall backward
when thou commest to age: wilt thou not Iule? It
stinted: and said I

She is the Fairies Midwife, &amp; she comes in shape no bigger
then Agat-stone, on the fore-finger of an Alderman,
drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, ouer mens noses as
they lie asleepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spinners
legs: the Couer of the wings of Grashoppers, her
Traces of the smallest Spiders web, her coullers of the
Moonshines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone,
the Lash of Philome, her Waggoner, a small gray-coated
Gnat, not halfe so bigge as a round little Worme, prickt
from the Lazie-finger of a man. Her Chariot is an emptie
Haselnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time
out a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: &amp; in this state she
gallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then
they dreame of Loue. On Courtiers knees, that dreame on
Cursies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on
Fees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which
oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their
breath with Sweet meats tainted are. Sometime she gallops
ore a Courtiers nose, &amp; then dreames he of smelling
out a sute: &amp; somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tickling
a Parsons nose as a lies asleepe, then he dreames of
another Benefice. Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers
necke, &amp; then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats, of
Breaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades: Of Healths fiue
Fadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which
he startes and wakes; and being thus frighted, sweares a
prayer or two &amp; sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that
plats the manes of Horses in the night: &amp; bakes the Elklocks
in foule sluttish haires, which once vntangled, much
misfortune bodes,
This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learnes them first to beare,
Making them women of good carriage:

   How nice the Quarrell was, and vrg'd withall
   <br/>
   Your high displeasure: all this vttered,
   <br/>
   With gentle breath, calme looke, knees humbly bow'd
   <br/>
   Could not take truce with the vnruly spleene
   <br/>
   Of Tybalts deafe to peace, but that he Tilts
   <br/>
   With Peircing steele at bold Mercutio's breast,
   <br/>
   Who all as hot, turnes deadly point to point,
   <br/>
   And with a Martiall scorne, with one hand beates
   <br/>
   Cold death aside, and with the other sends
   <br/>
   It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
   <br/>
   Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
   <br/>
   Hold Friends, Friends part, and swifter then his tongue,
   <br/>
   His aged arme, beats downe their fatall points,
   <br/>
   And twixt them rushes, vnderneath whose arme,
   <br/>
   An enuious thrust from Tybalt, hit the life
   <br/>
   Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
   <br/>
   But by and by comes backe to Romeo,
   <br/>
   Who had but newly entertained Reuenge,
   <br/>
   And too't they goe like lightning, for ere I
   <br/>
   Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slaine:
   <br/>

   And all those twenty could but kill one life.

   Fri. Hold thy desperate hand:
   <br/>
   Art thou a man? thy forme cries out thou art:
   <br/>
   Thy teares are womanish, thy wild acts denote
   <br/>
   The vnreasonable Furie of a beast.
   <br/>
   Vnseemely woman, in a seeming man,
   <br/>
   And ill beseeming beast in seeming both,
   <br/>
   Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,
   <br/>
   I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
   <br/>
   Hast thou slaine Tybalt? wilt thou slay thy selfe?
   <br/>
   And slay thy Lady, that in thy life lies,
   <br/>
   By doing damned hate vpon thy selfe?
   <br/>
   Why rayl'st thou on thy birth? the heauen and earth?
   <br/>
   Since birth, and heauen and earth, all three do meete
   <br/>
   In thee at once, which thou at once would'st loose.
   <br/>
   Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy loue, thy wit,
   <br/>
   Which like a Vsurer abound'st in all:
   <br/>
   And vsest none in that true vse indeed,
   <br/>
   Which should bedecke thy shape, thy loue, thy wit:
   <br/>
   Thy Noble shape, is but a forme of waxe,
   <br/>
   Digressing from the Valour of a man,
   <br/>
   Thy deare Loue sworne but hollow periurie,
   <br/>
   Killing that Loue which thou hast vow'd to cherish.
   <br/>
   Thy wit, that Ornament, to shape and Loue,
   <br/>
   Mishapen in the conduct of them both:
   <br/>
   Like powder in a skillesse Souldiers flaske,
   <br/>
   Is set a fire by thine owne ignorance,
   <br/>
   And thou dismembred with thine owne defence.
   <br/>
   What, rowse thee man, thy Iuliet is aliue,
   <br/>
   For whose deare sake thou wast but lately dead.
   <br/>
   There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
   <br/>
   But thou slew'st Tybalt, there art thou happie.
   <br/>
   The law that threatned death became thy Friend.
   <br/>
   And turn'd it to exile, there art thou happy.
   <br/>
   A packe or blessing light vpon thy backe,
   <br/>
   Happinesse Courts thee in her best array,
   <br/>
   But like a mishaped and sullen wench,
   <br/>
   Thou puttest vp thy Fortune and thy Loue:
   <br/>
   Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
   <br/>
   Goe get thee to thy Loue as was decreed,
   <br/>
   Ascend her Chamber, hence and comfort her:
   <br/>
   But looke thou stay not till the watch be set,
   <br/>
   For then thou canst not passe to Mantua,
   <br/>
   Where thou shalt liue till we can finde a time
   <br/>
   To blaze your marriage, reconcile your Friends,
   <br/>
   Beg pardon of thy Prince, and call thee backe,
   <br/>
   With twenty hundred thousand times more ioy
   <br/>
   Then thou went'st forth in lamentation.
   <br/>
   Goe before Nurse, commend me to thy Lady,
   <br/>
   And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
   <br/>
   Which heauy sorrow makes them apt vnto.

   Pa. Immoderately she weepes for Tybalts death,
   <br/>
   And therfore haue I little talke of Loue,
   <br/>
   For Venus smiles not in a house of teares.
   <br/>
   Now sir, her Father counts it dangerous
   <br/>
   That she doth giue her sorrow so much sway:
   <br/>
   And in his wisedome, hasts our marriage,
   <br/>
   To stop the inundation of her teares,
   <br/>
   Which too much minded by her selfe alone,
   <br/>
   May be put from her by societie.
   <br/>
   Now doe you know the reason of this hast?

   Fri. I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.

   Are you at leisure, Holy Father now,

   <br/>
   On Thursday next be married to this Countie

   <br/>
   Do thou but call my resolution wise,
   <br/>
   And with this knife, Ile helpe it presently.
   <br/>
   God ioyn'd my heart, and Romeos, thou our hands,

   And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd:
   <br/>
   Shall be the Labell to another Deede,

   Giue me some present counsell, or behold

   As that is desperate which we would preuent.

   If rather then to marrie Countie Paris

   Thou hast the strength of will to slay thy selfe,

   Then is it likely thou wilt vndertake
   <br/>
   A thing like death to chide away this shame,

   That coap'st with death himselfe, to scape fro it:

   Or walke in theeuish waies, or bid me lurke
   <br/>
   Where Serpents are: chaine me with roaring Beares
   <br/>
   Or hide me nightly in a Charnell house,
   <br/>
   Orecouered quite with dead mens ratling bones,
   <br/>
   With reckie shankes and yellow chappels sculls:
   <br/>
   Or bid me go into a new made graue,

   And hide me with a dead man in his graue,

   Things that to heare them told, haue made me tremble,

   To morrow night looke that thou lie alone,
   <br/>
   Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy Chamber:
   <br/>
   Take thou this Violl being then in bed,
   <br/>
   And this distilling liquor drinke thou off,
   <br/>
   When presently through all thy veines shall run,
   <br/>
   A cold and drowsie humour: for no pulse
   <br/>
   Shall keepe his natiue progresse, but surcease:
   <br/>
   No warmth, no breath shall testifie thou liuest,
   <br/>
   The Roses in thy lips and cheekes shall fade
   <br/>
   To many ashes, the eyes windowes fall
   <br/>
   Like death when he shut vp the day of life:
   <br/>
   Each part depriu'd of supple gouernment,
   <br/>
   Shall stiffe and starke, and cold appeare like death,
   <br/>
   And in this borrowed likenesse of shrunke death
   <br/>
   Thou shalt continue two and forty houres,
   <br/>
   And then awake, as from a pleasant sleepe.
   <br/>
   Now when the Bridegroome in the morning comes,
   <br/>
   To rowse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
   <br/>
   Then as the manner of our country is,
   <br/>
   In thy best Robes vncouer'd on the Beere,
   <br/>
   Be borne to buriall in thy kindreds graue:
   <br/>
   Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault,
   <br/>
   Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie,
   <br/>
   In the meane time against thou shalt awake,
   <br/>
   Shall Romeo by my Letters know our drift,
   <br/>
   And hither shall he come, and that very night
   <br/>
   Shall Romeo beare thee hence to Mantua.
   <br/>
   And this shall free thee from this present shame,
   <br/>
   If no inconstant toy nor womanish feare,
   <br/>
   Abate thy valour in the acting it
   <br/>

   <br/>
   Come to redeeme me? There's a fearefull point:
   <br/>
   Shall I not then be stifled in the Vault?
   <br/>
   To whose foule mouth no healthsome ayre breaths in,
   <br/>
   And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes.
   <br/>
   Or if I liue, is it not very like,
   <br/>
   The horrible conceit of death and night,
   <br/>
   Together with the terror of the place,
   <br/>
   As in a Vaulte, an ancient receptacle,
   <br/>
   Where for these many hundred yeeres the bones
   <br/>
   Of all my buried Auncestors are packt,
   <br/>
   Where bloody Tybalt, yet but greene in earth,
   <br/>
   Lies festring in his shrow'd, where as they say,
   <br/>
   At some houres in the night, Spirits resort:
   <br/>
   Alacke, alacke, is it not like that I
   <br/>
   So early waking, what with loathsome smels,
   <br/>
   And shrikes like Mandrakes torne out of the earth,
   <br/>
   That liuing mortalls hearing them, run mad.
   <br/>
   O if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
   <br/>
   Inuironed with all these hidious feares,
   <br/>
   And madly play with my forefathers ioynts?
   <br/>
   And plucke the mangled Tybalt from his shrow'd?
   <br/>
   And in this rage, with some great kinsmans bone,
   <br/>
   As (with a club) dash out my desperate braines.
   <br/>
   O looke, me thinks I see my Cozins Ghost,
   <br/>
   Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
   <br/>
   Vpon my Rapiers point: stay Tybalt, stay;
   <br/>
   Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here's drinke: I drinke to thee.

   Romeo there dead, was husband to that Iuliet,
   <br/>
   And she there dead, that's Romeos faithfull wife:
   <br/>
   I married them; and their stolne marriage day
   <br/>
   Was Tybalts Doomesday: whose vntimely death
   <br/>
   Banish'd the new-made Bridegroome from this Citie:
   <br/>
   For whom (and not for Tybalt) Iuliet pinde.
   <br/>
   You, to remoue that siege of Greefe from her,
   <br/>
   Betroth'd, and would haue married her perforce
   <br/>
   To Countie Paris. Then comes she to me,
   <br/>
   And (with wilde lookes) bid me deuise some meanes
   <br/>
   To rid her from this second Marriage,
   <br/>
   Or in my Cell there would she kill her selfe.
   <br/>
   Then gaue I her (so Tutor'd by my Art)
   <br/>
   A sleeping Potion, which so tooke effect
   <br/>
   As I intended, for it wrought on her
   <br/>
   The forme of death. Meane time, I writ to Romeo,
   <br/>
   That he should hither come, as this dyre night,
   <br/>
   To helpe to take her from her borrowed graue,
   <br/>
   Being the time the Potions force should cease.
   <br/>
   But he which bore my Letter, Frier Iohn,
   <br/>
   Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight
   <br/>
   Return'd my Letter backe. Then all alone,
   <br/>
   At the prefixed houre of her waking,
   <br/>
   Came I to take her from her Kindreds vault,
   <br/>
   Meaning to keepe her closely at my Cell,
   <br/>
   Till I conueniently could send to Romeo.
   <br/>
   But when I came (some Minute ere the time
   <br/>
   Of her awaking) heere vntimely lay
   <br/>
   The Noble Paris, and true Romeo dead.
   <br/>
   Shee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth,
   <br/>
   And beare this worke of Heauen, with patience:
   <br/>
   But then, a noyse did scarre me from the Tombe,
   <br/>
   And she (too desperate) would not go with me,
   <br/>
   But (as it seemes) did violence on her selfe.
   <br/>
   All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nurse is priuy:
   <br/>
   And if ought in this miscarried by my fault,
   <br/>
   Let my old life be sacrific'd, some houre before the time,
   <br/>
   Vnto the rigour of seuerest Law

   Prin. We still haue knowne thee for a Holy man.
   <br/>
   Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this?
   <br/>
   Boy. I brought my Master newes of Iuliets death,
   <br/>
   And then in poste he came from Mantua
   <br/>
   To this same place, to this same Monument.
   <br/>
   This Letter he early bid me giue his Father,
   <br/>
   And threatned me with death, going in the Vault,
   <br/>
   If I departed not, and left him there
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p id="id00725">
   Prin. Giue me the Letter, I will look on it.
   <br/>
   Where is the Counties Page that rais'd the Watch?
   <br/>
   Sirra, what made your Master in this place?
   <br/>
   Page. He came with flowres to strew his Ladies graue,
   <br/>
   And bid me stand aloofe, and so I did:
   <br/>
   Anon comes one with light to ope the Tombe,
   <br/>
   And by and by my Maister drew on him,
   <br/>
   And then I ran away to call the Watch
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p id="id00726">
   Prin. This Letter doth make good the Friers words,
   <br/>
   Their course of Loue, the tydings of her death:
   <br/>
   And heere he writes, that he did buy a poyson
   <br/>
   Of a poore Pothecarie, and therewithall
   <br/>
   Came to this Vault to dye, and lye with Iuliet.
   <br/>
   Where be these Enemies? Capulet, Mountague,
   <br/>
   See what a scourge is laide vpon your hate,
   <br/>
   That Heauen finds meanes to kill your ioyes with Loue;
   <br/>
   And I, for winking at your discords too,
   <br/>
   Haue lost a brace of Kinsmen: All are punish'd
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p id="id00727">
   Cap. O Brother Mountague, giue me thy hand,
   <br/>
   This is my Daughters ioynture, for no more
   <br/>
   Can I demand
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p id="id00728">
   Moun. But I can giue thee more:
   <br/>
   For I will raise her Statue in pure Gold,
   <br/>
   That whiles Verona by that name is knowne,
   <br/>
   There shall no figure at that Rate be set,
   <br/>
   As that of True and Faithfull Iuliet
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p id="id00729">
   Cap. As rich shall Romeo by his Lady ly,
   <br/>
   Poore sacrifices of our enmity
   <br/>
  </p>
  <p id="id00730">
   Prin. A glooming peace this morning with it brings,
   <br/>
   The Sunne for sorrow will not shew his head;
   <br/>
   Go hence, to haue more talke of these sad things,
   <br/>
   Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished.
   <br/>
   For neuer was a Storie of more Wo,
   <br/>
   Then this of Iuliet, and her Romeo.
