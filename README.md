# Mini Wifi Captive Library

A mini library disguised as a wifi captive portal that runs on the Wemos D1 Mini.

## Description

Sometimes a public wifi network will display a captive portal, which is a webpage associated with the
network that pops up when you try to connect. Some captive portals show advertisements, others bother
you for your email information, only a few are a secret mini wifi library stocked with classic public 
domain books for you to read.
